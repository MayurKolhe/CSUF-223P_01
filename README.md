1. Python Program to Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval.

A positive integer greater than 1 which has no other factors except 1 and the number itself is called a prime number.
2, 3, 5, 7 etc. are prime numbers as they do not have any other factors. But 6 is not prime (it is composite) since, 2 x 3 = 6.
2 . so we have porvided two input and program should return prime numbers between those two interval.
3. please provide the erroe message if the first input is greater then second input.
Example - 1 
Prime numbers between 600 and 650 are:
601 607 613 617 619 631 641 643 647
Example -2
Prime numbers between 1 and 50 are:
